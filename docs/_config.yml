  Notes & tutorials, 
  via unit test code snippets & docs HTML pages,
  for internationalization (i18n), programming languages, build tools, libraries, & more.
  In other words, what helps me reinforce ongoing learning.

# GitHub uses its own markdown renderer called CommonMarkGhPages.
#
# To use this we'd need to set the following options:
#     markdown: CommonMarkGhPages
#     Plugins:
#       jekyll-commonmark-ghpages
#  
#     commonmark:
#       options: ["SMART", "FOOTNOTES"]
#       extensions: ["strikethrough", "autolink", "table", "tagfilter"]
#
# However, it doesn't work well with Jekyll and the Just-The-Docs theme,
# and causes too many formatting problems. Additionally, it also doesn't
# have any support for auto-generating a Table of Contents (TOC) section
# for a page. Due to these reasons, we instead use the recommended
# markdown renderer for Jekyll, called kramdown.
#
markdown: kramdown

# Notes on plugins:
#  - GitHub Pages ignores all plugins included in the Gemfile.
#    - Only the ones listed in the _config.yml file (this file) are used.
#  - There is a very limited set of plugins that GH Pages supports (for security
#    reasons). The listing is here: https://pages.github.com/versions
#  - The jekyll-sitemap plugin generates a "sitemap.xml" for search engines.
#  - We need the "jemoji" plugin for rendering emoji like ":point_right:".
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jemoji
