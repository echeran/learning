# Elango's Learning - Notes & Tutorials

Here is I put content...
* ...in the form of notes & tutorials
* ...via unit tests / code snippets & documentation webpages
* ...for topics such as internationalization (i18n), programming languages, libraties, & build tools

It's really for me, but if you're here and find it useful to yourself, then I'm happy. Drop me a line if you want to let me know.
